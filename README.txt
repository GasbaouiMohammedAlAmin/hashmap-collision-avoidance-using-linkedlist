# hashmap-collision-avoidance-using-linkedlist
- We want to store a pair of data {identification, description} in a table with length v by avoiding the collision using a linked-list
- The position of the pair objects is calculated according to the summation order of identification property
Example pair1={"abc", " desc of abc"}
Key(pair1) =ord(a)+ ord(b)+ ord(c)=0+1+2=3
