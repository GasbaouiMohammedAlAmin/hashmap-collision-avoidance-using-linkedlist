# hashmap-collision-avoidance-using-linkedlist
- We want to store a pair of data {identification, description} in a table with length v by avoiding the collision using a linked-list
- The position of the pair objects is calculated according to the summation order of identification property

  Example pair1={"abc", " desc of abc"}
Key(pair1) =ord(a)+ ord(b)+ ord(c)=0+1+2=3

in this project, we create all required methods to implement this data structure :
- add an element to the table.
- delete an element from the table.
- print the whole table.
- checking if an object exists in the table.
- getting the number of empty slot.
